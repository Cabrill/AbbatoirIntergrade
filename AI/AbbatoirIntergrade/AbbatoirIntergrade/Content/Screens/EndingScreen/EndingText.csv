Positive,"Shepherd Cartalia of the colony X1407 was successful in brokering a peace treaty with the emergent artificial lifeform, Sang.  Through her efforts, the colonists and hybrid animals were able to find harmony living together.  The colonists adopted a vegetarian lifestyle, with assistance from Sang in modifying plants to provide balanced nutrition.  United, they continued to expand across the universe, colonizing countless worlds."
Neutral,"Shepherd Cartalia of the colony X1407 was only partially successful in brokering a peace treaty with the emergent artificial lifeform, Sang. Many chose to worship Sang and his creations, but those who did not did what was necessary to survive.  The surviving colonists were initially treated as indentured slaves, but eventually became household pets for the hybrid animals Sang had created.  Sang's children continued to spread throughout the universe, using the human's technology and workforce to rapidly expand and populate the habitable planets of the universe."
Negative,"Shepherd Cartalia of the colony X1407 was unsuccessful in brokering a peace treaty with the emergent lifeform, Sang.  Nor was she able to defeat through their numbers by force.  As a result, she and her people were forced to evacuate where their numbers dwindled in space until humanity eventually winked out of existence.  Sang's animals continued to proliferate on the many planets he controlled, but over time the circuitry of his many installations failed and without humans to repair them his consciousness eventually faded, sharing the fate of the humans he had condemned."
