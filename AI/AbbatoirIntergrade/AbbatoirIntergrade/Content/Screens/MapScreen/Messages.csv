Intro,"Welcome to The Abbatoir Intergrade.  The year is 2238, and you are assuming the role of Shepherd Cartalia of the colony X1407, a human colony on the habitable planet B382.  Earth is 20 light years away and has largely been abandoned after the climate became erratic, quickly alternating between extreme high and low temperatures.  

Your colony has been outfitted with the latest terraforming package provided by the Human Federation, which generously includes an AI module that modifies livestock DNA to generate edible lifeforms that area ideal to the planet conditions. Your settlement progress is going spectacularly, and you've managed to expand the colony from its meager initial size of 50 citizens in a valley, to over 1,000 citizens spread over several outposts. 

Unfortunately, the 'Sustenance and Nutrient Generator' you were given seems to be malfunctioning, as the animals have  become violent and are chasing down your people as they flee to the founding settlement.  Analyze the land, and specify defenses to turn them back while you search for a lasting solution."
